A good OS should...
1. Be usable by a 4 year old
2. Be easily managable (Apps, settings, etc)
3. Have wide package availibility
4. Have backward compatability (lots!)
5. Look nice
6. **Never** require the terminal (tho it should exist)
7. Have a global menu bar
8. Handle an app existing in multiple versions
9. Be stable
10. Have understandable folder names

TackOS will attempt to implement this in the following ways
1. Making a custom DE
2. Using AppImages, and having simple and straight to the point settings
3. Port Linux apps, and if a user tries to install a .deb file it should automatically generate an AppImage for it
4. FIXME
5. Mac OS like theme
6. Have a graphical tool for ***many*** config options
7. Use helloSystems Menubar
8. Use AppImage
9. FIXME
10. TODO
