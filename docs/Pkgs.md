# Packages

## Pkg Bundle Structure
For an example package of libsqsh
```
/System/Packages/libsqsh---.1.2.3/
├── pkg-info
└── chroot
	├── usr
	│	└── ...
	└── ... (basically an app installed to a chroot)
```

## Metadata file
```toml
# ./pkg-info

# currently only type 1 description files are supported.
InfoType = 1
DepsIncluded = false

# Neccesary fields
[Package]

Name = "Your Package Name"
Version = "4.5.6.7"
Arch = "Arch in the same format as debians e.g. amd64 arm64 etc."
Maintainer = "You/Your company's name"
Description = '''
The first line is the short description.
All the other lines are a description
which can span multiple lines.

Dependencies = '''
libsqsh (>= 1.2.3),
python (>= 3.10),
joy,
happiness,

## When (a) package(s) are/is pulled in by an app.
There is two ways we can handle it. One way is the symlink method which is more predictable but doesn't
scale well and also doesn't handle file, and then there is the overlayfs method which will be more
resource intensive while running, but would be more predictable and simple. Currently only the symlink
method is detailed but in the future the overlayfs method may get detailed if the cost of starting up
an app takes 38 seconds. `;)`


### Symlink method
First, all of the packages are added to a list of needed ones, this prevents recursion issues. Then,
in an involved process, ```pkg``` calulates ```bwrap``` arguments. This process goes as follows.

<strike> - First, We ```overlay``` the base system read-only with a tmpfs overtop so we can bind mount without
	changing the base system. e.g.
```
	...
	--overlay-src /
	--tmp-overlay /
	...
```
</strike>
 - Then we bind mount the ```System```, ```Users```, and ```Volumes```.

 ```
	--bind /System /System
	--bind /Users /Users
	--bind /Volumes /Volumes
 ```

 - Then we develop a tree of all the files and folders that need to be symlinked, along with their
	occurence count. As a bare minimum example.

 ```
 usr             = 2
 usr/bin         = 2
 usr/bin/bwrap   = 1
 usr/bin/bash    = 1
 usr/share/bwrap = 1
 usr/share/bash  = 1
 ```
> Any files or folders that have an occurence count of 1 can be symlinked. For files with an occurence
> count greater then 1, the file closest to the main package in the dependency tree will be chosen.
> For folders with an occurence count greater then 1, they will be created in the argument list
 - Then we symlink those. For example

```
	--mkdir usr
	--mkdir usr/bin
	--mkdir usr/share
	--symlink /System/Packages/bubblewrap0.11.0/chroot/usr/bin/bwrap /usr/bin/bwrap
	--symlink /System/Packages/bash5.6.7/chroot/usr/bin/bash /usr/bin/bash
	--symlink /System/Packages/bubblewrap0.11.0/chroot/usr/share/bubblewrap /usr/share/bubblewrap
	--symlink /System/Packages/bash5.6.7/chroot/usr/share/bash /usr/share/bash
```

> Potentially, if the cost of preforming the symlinks for every package/application gets to high, a
> static solution may have to be implemented. For now it will be done for each package/application.

Also, there is a special package in the system called ```base```, it is not the system but rather
a special package that is pulled in by all the others, it is nothing more then a pkg-info. An
application with sufficient priveleges, can add itself/another package to
```base```'s dependencies, to get automatically pulled in. For instance, an application installing a
font, would create a package for the font, and add it into ```base```'s deps.

```
base
├── pkg-info
└── chroot
```

The base system is also added to base's dependencies. More info in [MakeISO](MakeISO.md)
