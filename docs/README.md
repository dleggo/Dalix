# ![Logo](https://github.com/dleggo/Dalix/blob/main/Logos/Logo48x48.png?raw=true "Logo") Meet DalixOS! #

A project which aims to have a stunning macOS like appeal bringing the macOS like experience to Linux! This is not your traditional Linux distro as it abandons the FHS as much as possible, while implementing human readable file paths.


We want you to have an almost “Drop-In” replacement for macOS! Below is a list of the top features of Dalix that will be imitating the macOS look/feel.


Window button trafic lights: More of a preference thing, but still nice nonetheless.

Dock: macOS users love their dock, we will be working on implementing that into Dalix.

And a few more including, but not limited to, Global menu bar, control center, spatial finder, and automatic dependency resolving without breakage.

### The goal for DalixOS is is to be organized, stable, and user friendly and to be an OS that just works. ###
