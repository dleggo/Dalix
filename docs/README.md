# ![Logo](Logos/Logo48x48.png "Logo") Meet dalixOS!

An [open-source](https://github.com/FigSystems/dalixOS) project which aims to have a stunning macOS like
appeal, bringing the macOS like experience to Linux! This is not your traditional Linux distro as it
abandons the FHS as much as possible, while implementing human readable file paths.


We want you to have an almost “Drop-In” replacement for macOS! Below is a list of the top features of dalixOS that will be imitating the macOS look/feel.

 - **Window button trafic lights**: More of a preference thing, but still nice nonetheless.

 - **Dock**: macOS users love their dock, we will be working on implementing that into Dalix.

 - **Global menu bar**: A global menu bar has been shown to be much faster then a menu bar at the top of the window. dalixOS will be implementing that too.

And a few more including, but not limited to, Control center, spatial finder, and automatic dependency resolution without breakage.

> The goal for dalixOS is to be organized, stable, user friendly, and just work.
