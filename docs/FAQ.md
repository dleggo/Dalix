## What makes Falkon OS different
Falkon OS completly ditches FHS and implements human readable names like ```System```, ```Applications```, etc.
Another thing worth noting is that while Falkon uses these paths, it can install debian packages quite nativly. This
works by having ```falkond``` running in the background monitering for changes in ```Applications```.
