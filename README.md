# ![Logo](Logos/Logo48x48.png) dalixOS
The goal for dalixOS is to be organized, stable, user friendly, and just work.
It will have a stunning macOS like appeal and will use a simplified folder setup that actually
makes sense. ``` System ```  for important files, ``` Applications ``` for apps, and ``` Users ```
for your files. No more cryptic names like ```usr```, ```var```, and ```bin``` to have to worry about. You shouldn't have to be a rocket scientist to use a computer!

This seperate organization for each application and system package will let you have multiple app
versions without conflict. Installing new software will be a breeze. Drop an Application
(```.deb``` or ```.app```) into the ``` Applications ``` folder, and dalixOS will convert it into a
App-Bundle, installing any dependencies automatically! It’s like macOS, but without the Apple nonsense.
Letting you do what you need, without wrestling with difficult cli
package managers. dalixOS's motto is **The filesystem is the package manager**.


dalixOS will also automatically clean up unused dependencies so your disk isn’t filled up with unused
files!

We are currently under heavy development so expect [issues](https://github.com/dleggo/Dalix/issues).
