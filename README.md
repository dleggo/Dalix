# Dalix
The idea for DalixOS is that the simplicity should be noticed immediately. It will have a stunning macOS like appeal and the plan is that it will use a simplified folder setup that just makes sense! ``` System ```  for important files, ``` Applications ``` for apps, and ``` Users ``` for your files. It’s what everything you need and nothing that you don’t!

DalixOS’s stability will be clear from the first use. The special file system keeps essential files safe, which will let you run multiple app versions without conflict. Installing new software should be a breeze. Drop an Application into the ``` Applications ``` folder, and DalixOS should convert it into a  App-Bundle, installing any dependencies automatically. It’s just like macOS, but without the ever-changing compatibility!

It's everything you need and nothing that you don't! Letting you do what you need, without “Un-User-Friendly” package managers!


DalixOS will also auto clean up unused dependencies so your disk isn’t filled up with unused files!

The goal for DalixOS is is to be organized, stable, and user friendly and an OS that just works.
